# 1.3.1 Classes

In many object-oriented approaches, it is possible to define classes that describe the attributes and the behavior of a set of objects (the instances of a class) abstractly and thus group common features of objects. For example, people have a name, an address, and a social security number. Courses have a unique identifier, a title, and a description. Lecture halls have a name as well as a location, etc. A class also defines a set of permitted operations that can be applied to the instaces of the class. FOr example, you can reserve a lecture hall for a certain date, a student can register for an exam, etc. In this way, classes describe the behavior of objets.
